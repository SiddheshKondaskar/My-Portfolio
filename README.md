## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Flutter SDK installed on your machine. You can download and install Flutter from the official Flutter website: [https://flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev)

2. Clone the repository using Git or download the source code as a ZIP package.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

5. Connect a physical device or start an emulator/simulator.

6. Run the app using the following command:

   ```
   flutter run
   ```

   This will build the app and deploy it to the connected device or emulator/simulator.

   If you want to run the app on a specific device or simulator, use the `-d` flag followed by the device ID. For example:

   ```
   flutter run -d <device-id>
   ```

   Replace `<device-id>` with the ID of the target device or simulator.

7. The app should launch on the device or simulator, and you can now interact with it.

   Note: Make sure the device or simulator is connected and recognized by Flutter. You can check the device status by running the command:

   ```
   flutter devices
   ```

   This will display a list of available devices and their status.
